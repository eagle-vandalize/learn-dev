Round Robin (Default Algorithm for Application Load Balancer and Classic Load Balancer):
Use Case: Ideal for scenarios where all targets have roughly the same capacity and can handle the same types of requests. It's commonly used when instances are similarly configured.
Example: If there are three instances (A, B, C), requests will be distributed in the order: A → B → C → A → B → C, and so on.

Least Outstanding Requests (Algorithm for Application Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer) 
Example: If there are three targets (A, B, C) and target A is processing fewer requests than the others, new traffic will be sent to A.


 Weighted Round Robin (Classic Load Balancer, used in combination with target group weights in Application Load Balancer)
Example: If instances A, B, and C are given weights 3, 1, and 2 respectively, the traffic will be distributed as follows:
3 requests to A, 1 to B, and 2 to C in each cycle.


 IP Hash (Classic Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer)
Example: A request from IP address 192.168.1.1 might be hashed to a particular instance based on the algorithm, ensuring that subsequent requests from the same IP are directed to the same instance.

Least Connections (Network Load Balancer)
Example: If targets A, B, and C have 10, 5, and 2 active connections respectively, the next incoming connection will be routed to target C, as it has the least number of active connections.

Target Group Stickiness (Sticky Sessions for Application Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer)
Example: Once a client is directed to target A, future requests from the same client will always go to target A, based on the session cookie.
